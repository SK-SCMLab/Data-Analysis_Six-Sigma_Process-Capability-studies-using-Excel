# 🏊🏻 Process Capability Indices and interpretation in Manufacturing operations using Microsoft Excel
This repository represents a structured analysis of process capability study in a steel manufacturing workflow involving three sequential machines: 

1. **Rolling**
2. **Cutting**
3. **Folding**

Each machine plays a crucial role in shaping, resizing, and finishing steel sheets to final product specifications.

## 🤹🏻 Process Capability Studies
Process capability is how well the process is meeting customer (Cx) needs and expectations. It is a metric that reflects only the common cause of variation

| *Natural Process Limits* | *Specification limits* |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|1. Indicators of process variations | 1. Target set for the process |
|2. Voice of the process | 2. Voice of the CX |
|3. Based on the past performance | 3. Based on the CX requirements |
|4. Real-time values | 4. Intended result |
|5. Derived from process data | 5. Defined by the CX |
|6. Consists of Upper Control Limit (UCL) & Lower Control Limit (LCL)| 6. Consists of Upper Specification Limit (USL) & Lower Specification Limit (LSL) |
